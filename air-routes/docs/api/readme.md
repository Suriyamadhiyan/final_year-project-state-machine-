## Main classes

The state machine comprises 3 main classes of note:

#### `StateMachine`
 
The main instantiated class and entry point to managing state; its main responsibilities are:

- Instantiating the system
- Looking after the overall configuration
- Converting shorthand notation to configuration
- Adding and removing transitions (actions and states)
- Adding and removing event handlers
- Executing actions and dispatching events
- Pausing, resuming, cancelling and ending transitions


#### `TransitionMap`

The brain of the state machine; its responsibilities are:

- Building and storing the relationships between states
- Determining what states are allowed to link
- Determining what actions are allowed to run
- Maintaining a high-performance cache of action and event names


#### `Transition`

The class responsible for all lifecycle events between states; a single transition is instantiated for each action. It's main tasks are:

- Preparing the callbacks, events and parameters for each transition
- Queuing only registered event handlers
- Calling the event handlers in order, and passing the correct parameters
- Responding to the returned results


## Events

There are 4 event classes:

- `SystemEvent` - dispatched for any action lifecycle events, i.e. `start`, `change`, `update`
- `TransitionEvent` - dispatched for any action lifecycle events, i.e. `pause`, `resume` and `cancel`
- `ActionEvent` - dispatched for any action lifecycle events, i.e. `start` and `end`
- `StateEvent` - dispatched for any state lifecycle events, i.e. `leave` and `enter`


## Visual

The following [ASCII](https://github.com/davestewart/javascript-ascii) output gives you an idea of how the classes work together:
